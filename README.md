# Fundamentals-of-Programming-with-Python

Welcome to this course. This course will not only teach you python, but also a lot of fundamental concepts I believe are missed or not taught properly in most courses on youtube, udemy, or any where online. There will also be many exercises and projects so that you can learn to reinforce the concepts and tie all the concepts together. This course is best for beginners, those who know the concepts but need practice with it (this is the hardest part of programming), people who are stuck in what they call "tutorial hell", and those who rely too much on AI to code (Vibe coding). 

There are 6 chapters in this course, and each chapter will have a lesson (teaches theory but also provides lots of practice exercises), as well as projects. Keep in mind, this course starts very easy, and gets progressively harder by the end. I would say the first 3 chapters are easy peasy, and the last 3 are the hardest (especially the last 2). For each chapter, there is a "instructions" file that will guide you on what files you should open in order. 

Here is an brief overview of what you will do in this course:

1. Chapter 1 - Variables, Print function, User Input, Type Casting, Math Functions and Order of Operations when coding, Changing Variables
2. Chapter 2 - Functions, Variable Scoping, Functions In Depth
3. Chapter 3 - Conditional Logic, Programming Order of Operations, If statements
   Project: Trivia Quiz
4. Chapter 4 - For Loops, While Loops
  Project: Guessing Game
5. Chapter 5 - Lists, Strings, 2D Lists, Sets, Tuples, Dictionaries, and when to use which data structure
   Project: Social Media Network Simulator, University Data Analysis
6. Chapter 6 - Object Oriented Programming
   Project: Polynomial Calculator, Song Playlist Editor
